                <p>As described by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiln">Wikipedia</a>, KILN is...</p>

                <blockquote>
                    A kiln is a thermally insulated chamber, or oven, in which a controlled temperature regime is produced. Uses include the hardening, burning or drying of materials. Kilns are also used for the firing of materials, such as clay and other raw materials, to form ceramics (including pottery, bricks etc.)
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    Kiln is an open source platform for log aggregation, visualization and analysis. The goal of Kiln is to provide a one stop log visualization platform that provides engineers, managers, and other stakeholders access to log files for multiple applications and environments without the hassle of having to tail log files or browse complex directory structures on remote repositories such as the ones generated by applications deployed on Elastic Beanstalk.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Installing and deploying Kiln is easy, and publishing to Kiln is even easier. Kiln stores all of its data on database (<b>MongoDB</b>) enabling you to establish backup and storage policies that best fit your needs.

                <p>
                    Kiln comes pre-configured with basic settings and ready to deploy. While intent is to have administrators configure Kiln from the application itself, we currently only support configuration changes through modifications to a few text files. In order to customize Kiln, you may modify the following configuration files, relative to the application root:
                </p>

                <h4>config/kiln.yml</h4>
                <dl>
                    <dt>[environemnt]:allow_new_users</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Determines where the application allows new users to register. If set to false only existing users will have access to the application. You can use this option to prevent unauthorized users to see your log files.
                    </dd>
                </dl>

                <h4>config/mongo.yml</h4>
                <dl>
                    <dt>[environment]:host</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The hostname or IP address of your MongoDB instance.
                    </dd>
                </dl>

                <dl>
                    <dt>[environment]:port</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The port used to connect to your MongoDB instance.
                    </dd>
                </dl>

                <dl>
                    <dt>[environment]:database</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The name of the database you want to use for storing the log events.
                    </dd>
                </dl>

                <dl>
                    <dt>[environment]:username</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The username used to connect to your MongoDB instance. We recommend you leave this as an environment variable for easier configuration.
                    </dd>
                </dl>

                <dl>
                    <dt>[environment]:password</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The password used to connect to your MongoDB instance. We recommend you leave this as an environment variable for easier configuration.
